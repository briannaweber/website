      <description>When professor Woodward said that we would be learning python, I was very apprehensive.I felt as though it took me a very long time to get a very basic understanding of R and R studio. Needless to say I was not excited about having to learn a second coding language.While there were a few small differences between R and python that would makes a large difference in the output to get used to I did not find python as difficult as I had expected.</description>
