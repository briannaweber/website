## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{python}
import numpy as np

# Use these values to calculate scores
match_score = 2
mismatch_score = -1
gap_penalty = -1

# Make a score matrix with these two sequences
seq1 = "ATGAT"
seq2 = "AAGGAT"


def sw_function(seq1,seq2,gap_penalty=-1, match_score=1, mismatch_score=-1):
    m=len(seq1) #length of horizontal sequence
    n=len(seq2) #length of vertical sequence
    score=np.empty(shape=[n+1,m+1]) #array to hold scores
   
    for j in range(0, m + 1): score[0][j] = gap_penalty * j
    for i in range(0, n + 1): score[i][0] = gap_penalty * i
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1): 
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            insert = score[i - 1][j] + gap_penalty 
            delete = score[i][j - 1] + gap_penalty 
            match = score[i - 1][j - 1] + match_score if seq1[j-1]==seq2[i-1] else mismatch_score
            score[i][j] = max(match, delete, insert)
    return score


mat=sw_function(seq1,seq2,gap_penalty,match_score,mismatch_score)

def sw_fun(mat):
    for i in range(len(mat)):
        for j in range(len(mat[i])):
            if mat[i][j]<0: 
                mat[i][j]=0
            
    return mat

sw_fun(mat)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
